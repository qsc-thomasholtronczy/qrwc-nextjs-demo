# Welcome to a QRWC demo featuring Next.JS

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, locate "qrwc-demo.qsys" and configure and load the file to a core. The default core is a core nano.

** This demo is running on QDS: qrwc_beta.2408.291. Please contact an admin at Developers.QSC.com for access **

Then, open the project in VSCode and navigate to '.env.local'

Open this file and replace the default IP with the IP of your Q-SYS Core

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
